 In Combine, methods that perform an operation on values coming from a publisher are called operators.
 
 Each Combine operator actually returns a publisher. Generally speaking, that publisher receives the upstream values, manipulates the data, and then sends that data downstream.
 
 To streamline things conceptually, the focus will be on using the operator and working with its output.

# Recursive Enumerations

A `recursive enumeration` is an enumeration that has another instance of the enumeration as the associated value for one or more of the enumeration cases. You indicate that an enumeration case is recursive by writing `indirect` before it, which tells the compiler to insert the necessary layer of indirection.

```
indirect enum ArithmeticExpression {
  case number(Int)
  case addition(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
  case multiplication(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
}

let five = ArithmeticExpression.number(5)
let four = ArithmeticExpression.number(4)
let sum = ArithmeticExpression.addition(five, four)
let product = ArithmeticExpression.multiplication(sum, ArithmeticExpression.number(3))

func evaluate(_ expression: ArithmeticExpression) -> Int  {
  switch expression {
  case let .number(value):
    return value
  case let .addition(left, right):
    return evaluate(left) + evaluate(right)
  case let .multiplication(left, right):
    return evaluate(left) * evaluate(right)
    
  }
}

print(evaluate(product))

```
